# Crow Watch
#### An App for Watching My Deck

##But Why?

After moving to Oakland, CA from NYC, my wife and I were overjoyed to
have an apartment with outdoor space.  Soon enough we had a smattering of
succulents, herbs, flowers, and 2 lemon trees.

Our joy and pleasure was short lived, however.  A murder of crows spent their days flitting from perch to perch on our block, with several of these perches located on our deck furniture and railings.  Our outdoor sanctuary was a crow toilet...Gross!

Inspired by [Dave Ceddia's](https://daveceddia.com/) post about [pulled pork and react native](https://daveceddia.com/perfect-pulled-pork-react-native-expo-express/) I decided to dive into React Native and AWS in order to try and prevent crows from hanging out on my deck.
